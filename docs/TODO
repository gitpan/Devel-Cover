- Enhancements:
  - Different criteria for different runs.
  - Marking of unreachable code - commandline tool and gui.
  - Threads support.
  - Test analysis.
  - Profiling and speedups.
  - Collect data for path coverage.
  - Mutation coverage.
  - Regular Expression coverage.
  - Indicate how to increase coverage?
  - BEGIN and CHECK blocks and code in modules.  Requires callbacks from perl?
  - Create a base class for Devel::Cover::Branch and Devel::Cover::Condition.
  - Handle C< $y || "${p}qqq" >.
    - 22:09 <@nothingmuch> return, redo, next, last, goto should probably all
                           be treated as short circuiting
  - Add aliased subroutines to subroutine coverage.
  - Accommodate reloading modules at runtime (Mark Glines).
  - Don't count BEGIN blocks as subroutines.
  - Only collect boolean data for coverage information (no counts).
  - cpancover
    - Extend cpancover so people can upload databases.
    - Provide a view by author.
    - Make cpancover more general to be able to work on local modules.
- Reports:
  - Improve textual output.
  - Remove >= 100% in customisable thresholds.
  - Move HTML version and platform info to main page and allow for multiples.
  - Add -db option to cover.
  - Diff functionality.
  - Merge CSS from basic_html and cpancover.
  - Provide a way to control syntax colouring.
  - Cyclomatic complexity annotation.
- Bugs:
  - Work with memoize.  Is this still a problem?
  - See if the XS code leaks, and fix it if it does.
  - Look at time coverage again - collecting for too many ops?
  - Sort out time coverage on Windows.
  - Check for core dumps with pod coverage.
  - Uncovered dereferences as seen in svk.
  - Fix "ignored" errors - see IO::Pager.
  - cpancover on CPAN:
    - PerlIO-eol-0.13 hangs.
    - CPAN@1432 hangs with bleadperl@29642.
  - cover -delete uses too much memory when cover_db doesn't exist. (clkao)
  - Games::Bingo broken.
  - Class::Unload only giving 50% coverage on return unless ... (losing data?)
  - JSON error in Archive::Extract and Test::LeakTrace.
  - cover -write new_db doesn't work (meeds structire?).
- Testing:
  - Be able to run Devel::Cover on itself.
  - More comprehensive.
  - Functional tests.
  - Overhaul test system.  Include patt?
  - Tests for INIT and END blocks included in required files when the
    files are used in some runs.
  - Make sure dor is handled correctly and add more tests to cond_or.
- Build:
  - Fix up make text and friends for module_ignore.
  - Check for matching threadedness, 64bits etc. between build and run?
  - Turn Perl build lines into a script to work on Win32 etc.
- Documentation:
  - General improvement.
  - Examples.
  - Cookbook including +/-inc, +/-ignore and +/-select.
  - Document cpancover options.
  - Pod in private modules.
  - Developer documentation.
  - Better DB API docs (including writing?).
