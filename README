NAME
    Devel::Cover - a module to provide code coverage for Perl

    Version 0.04 - 12th May 2001

DESCRIPTION
    Copyright 2001, Paul Johnson (pjcj@cpan.org)

    This software is free. It is licensed under the same terms as Perl
    itself.

    The latest version of this software should be available from my
    homepage: http://www.pjcj.net

    This module provides code coverage for Perl.

    If you can't guess by the version number this is an alpha release.

    Code coverage data are collected using a plugable runops function which
    counts how many times each op is executed. These data are then mapped
    back to reality using the B compiler modules.

    At the moment, only statement coverage and condition coverage
    information is reported. Coverage data for other metrics are collected,
    but not reported. Coverage data for some metrics are not yet collected.

    You may find that the results don't match your expectations. I would
    imagine that at least one of them is wrong.

    Requirements: Perl 5.6.1 or 5.7.1. The ability to compile XS extensions.
