NAME
    Devel::Cover - Code coverage metrics for Perl

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl.

    If you can't guess by the version number this is an alpha release.

    Code coverage data are collected using a plugable runops function which
    counts how many times each op is executed. These data are then mapped
    back to reality using the B compiler modules.

    The cover program can be used to generate coverage reports.

    At the moment, only statement coverage and pod coverage information is
    reported. Condition coverage data is available, not accurate at the
    moment, though statement coverage data should be reasonable. Coverage
    data for other metrics are collected, but not reported. Coverage data
    for some metrics are not yet collected.

    You may find that the results don't match your expectations. I would
    imagine that at least one of them is wrong.

    Requirements: Perl 5.6.1 or 5.7.1. The ability to compile XS extensions.
    Pod::Coverage if you want pod coverage.
