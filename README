NAME
    Devel::Cover - Code coverage metrics for Perl

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl.

    If you can't guess by the version number this is an alpha release.

    Code coverage data are collected using a plugable runops function which
    counts how many times each op is executed. These data are then mapped
    back to reality using the B compiler modules. There is also a statement
    profiling facility which needs a better backend to be really useful.

    The cover program can be used to generate coverage reports.

    At the moment, only statement, pod and time coverage information is
    reported. Condition coverage data is available, though not accurate at
    the moment. Statement coverage data should be reasonable, although there
    may be some statements which are no reported. Pod coverage comes from
    Pod::Coverage. Coverage data for other metrics are collected, but not
    reported. Coverage data for some metrics are not yet collected.

    The gcov2perl program can be used to convert gcov files to Devel::Cover
    databases.

    You may find that the results don't match your expectations. I would
    imagine that at least one of them is wrong.

    Requirements:

      Perl 5.6.1 or 5.7.1.
      The ability to compile XS extensions.
      Pod::Coverage if you want pod coverage.
